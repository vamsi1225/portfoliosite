        I’m a full stack web developer with 3 years of experience building responsive, scalable, and user-focused applications. From crafting clean front-end interfaces with React, Angular, and Material UI to building robust backends using Node.js, Express.js, GraphQL, MySQL and PostgreSQL, I enjoy owning the full development pipeline especially when deploying cloud-native solutions on AWS (S3, RDS, Lambda, Step Functions).

I've delivered real-world solutions across healthcare, e-commerce, and internal enterprise platforms, focusing on reliability, performance, and user experience. I work comfortably with TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, and modern tools like TypeORM, Apollo Client, and MongoDB. Git is my daily companion, and I value clean version control, modular design, and readable code.

I’m also exploring how AI can be integrated into full stack apps to make them smarter, faster, and more adaptive. I’m always excited to learn new technologies, collaborate with teams, and solve meaningful problems through code.

          My professional journey began at <strong>ABSYZ Inc.</strong>, where I’ve grown through every role — from intern to lead engineer. I’ve led teams, shipped real products, and explored the full stack while staying deeply connected to design and user experience.
