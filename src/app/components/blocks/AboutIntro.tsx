          Who am I ?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I was born in the humble town of <strong>Goleti, Telangana</strong>, where curiosity sparked my journey into tech. Over the years, I’ve evolved from a self-taught tinkerer into a full-stack developer driven by clean UI, fast APIs, and building things that matter.

        <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          My professional journey began at <strong>ABSYZ Inc.</strong>, where I’ve grown through every role — from intern to lead engineer. I’ve led teams, shipped real products, and explored the full stack while staying deeply connected to design and user experience.
